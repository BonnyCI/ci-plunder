Welcome to the BonnyCI CI Research Project!

The goal of this project is to understand discover what value Continuous
Integration provides to community-based projects.

This research uses the R programming language and R notebooks to perform data
analysis and to present reports. The data are archived in Google BigQuery and
Google Cloud Storage. Data sets are stored as Google BigQuery tables with
smaller summary datasets stored in-repo as RDS files.

Information for specific data sets are included in the report they are
associated with.

The research roadmap consists of the following phases:

 I. Exploration and Identifying Questions

 II. GitHub Demographics Analysis

 III. TravisCI Demographics Analysis (based on GitHub project data)

 IV. Measuring Value: Participation, Resilience, and Code Quality

 V. Qualitative Data Collection (Survey)

 VI.Publish and Present Findings

Each phase is tracked in milestones:
