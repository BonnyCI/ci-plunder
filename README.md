# ci-plunder
CI usage data plundering

Roadmap:

1) Initial Questions (need to be refined)
- How do open source projects use TravisCI?
- What is the current error rate for new code in projects that use TravisCI compared to projects that don't use any CI?
- Would the features BonnyCI proposes decrease errors in new code for current users of TravisCI?
- What is the current overall CI complexity of a project that uses TravisCI, including CI workflows that fall outside of TravisCI?
- How would BonnyCI's current proposed features impact the overall CI complexity for projects that currently use TravisCI?

2) Data Exploration:
- available data set: https://travistorrent.testroots.org/
- verify the data, is it sufficient to answer our questions?

3) Iteration on 1 and 2
- until we have clear questions that we know we can answer given our data set

4) Statistical models to summarize the data
- tbd based on the questions

5) Form Hypotheses and test them against a larger data set

6) iteration on steps 4 and 5

7) Present results
- How do the results of this research compare with BonnyCI assumptions and features?
- What further questions do we have as a result of this research?
